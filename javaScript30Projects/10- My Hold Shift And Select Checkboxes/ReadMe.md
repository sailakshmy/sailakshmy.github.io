The steps for this project are as follows:-
1) Get the list of checkboxes available 
2) Check each one for a click event
3) Store the first selected checkbox into a variable
4) Check if they are selecting the checkbox to check it(and not to uncheck it)
5) Check if the Shift key is pressed
6) If 4 and 5 are true, loop over every checkbox to see the first checked and the last checked
7) if either of these are true, then set a variable to true
8) If the variable is true, then select the check of that checkbox

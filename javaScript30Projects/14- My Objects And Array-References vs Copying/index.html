    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
        let team = players;
        console.log(players);
        console.log(team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

        console.log(players, team);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
        let team2 = players.slice();
        console.log(players, team2);
        team2[4] = "I was added via slice()";

        console.log(players, team3);
        team3[4] = "I was added via concatenate()";
        console.log(players, team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        let team4 = [...players];
        console.log(players, team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        team4[4] = "I was added via the ES6 Spread Operator";
        console.log(players, team4);

    // Use the Array.from() method
        team5 = Array.from(players);
        console.log(players, team5);
        team5[4] = "I was added via Array.from()";
        console.log(players, team5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
        let captain = person;
        console.log(person, captain);
        captain.number = 99;
        console.log(person, captain);

        console.log(person, cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
       /* const cap2 = { ...person };*/
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
